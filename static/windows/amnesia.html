<h2 style="text-align: center;">Amnesia</h2>
<p>
	Amnesia is a .dll library that allows for editing memory pointers of live-running applications. 
	There are several other libraries and even apps for this however to my knowlege; none allow you to 
	work with application modules in your pointers which really holds you back from a lot of processes.
	For example, if you're trying to manupulate a unity engine game, you might find your pointers preceded by 
	"unityengine.dll" or "mono.dll". My library actually accounts for these, allowing you to manipulate a wide range 
	of programs.
